# MathArena

A website to do mathematics.
People can do exercices posted by others users.

The frontend is written in Typescript with VueJS 3.

The backend (come soon) will be written in Typescript with AdonisJS.

## Roadmap
- Create all the interfaces of the website
- Create a convolution model to extract latex from a picture.
